Hi, I'm Angela! This is my new blog where I plan to post about whatever's on my mind, as well as things I'm working on.

This website was made with the help of [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/), although I'm hoping to switch to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) sometime in the near future. Although this is the first website I've made that's actually *been* on the web, I got most of my HTML/CSS experience making a very detailed website about Roborovski dwarf hamsters (of all things!) when I was around 9.

I'm a college freshman currently majoring in Computer Science at Las Positas College, and I'm planning to transfer to a UC and major in Astrophysics in a couple of years. Some things I enjoy doing in my free time include doodling (definitely not during class or anything...), reading (especially fantasy and sci-fi books!), playing piano, and journaling.
